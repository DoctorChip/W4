						We're cool guys, honest. We make websites, cook pizza and grow weed.
						When we're not doing these things though, we mostly work for other companies,
						selling our labour for the profit of the rich in order to buy food, housing 
						and more, which in turn simply gives our earned currency back to the rich.
						It's an endless cycle of profit for the corporate giants, and a prison in
						which every man, woman and child of the working class will forever be stuck.
